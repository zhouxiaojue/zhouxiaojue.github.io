# Biography

I am a currently a research specialist at University of Wisconsin Madison. My research interests started from the question of whether we can build a human mind outside of human body. From that on I have been learning about human cognition (mostly psycholinguistic and memory) and machine learning. Also, I have been working with processing and analysing both monkey and human brain imaging such as fMRI, PET and DTI. All in the hope that we can understand human cognition through brain imaging using various machine learning technique.
