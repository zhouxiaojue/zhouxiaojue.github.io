Recent theories have heavily relied on the observation of category-specific activations, i.e., the preferential activations in brain regions for specific semantic categories. With decades of research, a full understanding of the organization has not yet been reached, since little is known about the factors that contribute to the variances in observed activation patterns across numerous neuroimaging studies. In this study, we first reviewed 97 published papers that reported category-specific activations for living or nonliving concepts in the past two decades. Then, using the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method, we characterized the brain activation associated with living and nonliving concepts, revealing the influences of relevant factors (e.g., neuroimaging mode, task demands, and stimuli modality), and analyzing these findings in relation to theoretical accounts of cortical semantic networks.","tags":null,"title":"Where for what: A meta-analysis for the category-specific activations for living/nonliving concepts in the past two decades","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["Imaging Analysis","tutorial"],"content":"","date":1607715565,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607715565,"objectID":"2eb425f7265ebe226cdcb84f91279f4c","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/post/imageorientation/","publishdate":"2020-12-11T11:39:25-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/imageorientation/","section":"post","summary":"So your neuroimage data somehow is flipped, what do you do?","tags":["Imaging Analysis","nifti","Brain Voyager","afni","FSL","freesurfer"],"title":"Neuroimage format and orientation information in nifti","type":"post"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou","Emily Grossman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"cbba2190022eef306e7cdd59f8d4aaa8","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/ifg2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ifg2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sensory and Social Cognitive Networks Connectivity Depends on Attentive States.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Stehr","Xiaojue Zhou","Mariel Tisby","Patrick Hwu","John Pyles","Emily Grossman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"856dc3b3c3b856e9ab877a5fddd0553e","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/mvpa2020_2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mvpa2020_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To test for the influence of top-down influences on action perceptual encoding, we evaluated the statistical structure of the multivariate activation pattern from the pSTS while observers attended to the different dimensions (the action kinematics, the goal, or the identity) of an avatar engaged in two different actions. Multivariate pattern decoding accuracy varied as a function of attention instruction in the right pSTS, but not in the other regions of the AON, with the highest classification when observers attended to the action kinematics. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the pSTS and inferior frontal cortex (IFC) was stronger when observers attended to the actions portrayed in the vignettes.

However, if we oversample in one subpopulation, then we have to correct for the oversampling. For example, autism twins are very rare. If we want to accurately measure their psychologycal assessments, we want to upsample by intentionally taking more measurements in autism twin pairs than we would if we stay true to the ratio of autism twin pairs to normal twin pairs.\nHere, RDoC Study (2010-2012) Subsampling of Twin Pairs With Unequal Probability was a health survey on functional and structural neuroimaging and psychological assessments. They used a power strategy and took more samples in autism twin pairs.\nMy problem here is to pick a statistical strategy to estimate the true weights so the researchers can apply on their measurements to achieve both efficient and unbiased analysis.\nApproach Models to estimate weights Current study looks at different ways to calculate sample weights and compare their performances on the current dataset. Here, linear regression, polynomial regression, gamma linear regression, and gamma polynomial regression were used to estimate weights.\nBootstrapping to evaluate model performance 10000 times bootstrapping were performed to evaluate how different models performed in estimating weights.\nMeasurements of model performance   Efficiency : Ratio of standard deviation of bootstrapped original weights comparing to bootstrapped weights based on various methods described above. This is telling us how our newly estimated weights varied comparing to original weights.\n  Bias : Difference between average bootstrapped estimates. Here, it is the difference between original weights to bootstrapped weights based on methods described above. This is telling us how different our newly estimated weights comparing to original weights.\n  Results 1. Were the parameters biased?\nThe table below indicated that the parameter estimates were close to it\u0026rsquo;s original estimates. Also, across all the models, bias of different estimates (age, race, etc.,) were around zero. 2. Were the estimated weights efficient?\nHere, yg and xyg model, which was gamma modeling of unsmoothed and smoothed sampling weights had the highest efficiency in estimating weights.\nConclusion While all the models used above can estimate accuracte weights, Gamma and linear models using either un-smoothed or smoothed estimates have the highest efficiency in estimating weights.\nResource You can find the R code to do this analysis in my github respoitory.\n","date":1462313653,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462313653,"objectID":"a6a869e80cfd8edbfdb55b970b487756","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/project/surveyweight/","publishdate":"2016-05-03T14:14:13-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/surveyweight/","section":"project","summary":"Comparing different approaches to correct oversample datasets.","tags":["statistics"],"title":"Statistical Analysis of Weighted Survey Data in R","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["experimental design"],"content":"The Problem Past studies already demonstrate strong emotional content of words improves people’s immediate recall memory and consistent colors further enhance memory(Donald et al., 2004). It is interesting to see if same conclusion can be draw on metamemory and whether the color still interacts with emotion. If so, we can say this effect is immediate and on-line.\nBesides looking at people’s memory ability, we can also look at how people recognize this cognitive ability. Metacognition is “thinking of thinking”. Metamemory is the introspective cognition about one’s own memory ability. It is a self-judgment. While people’s natural memory capacity would restrain number of words actually remembered, words’ attributes may have larger effect on decision of one’s judgment of memory ability.\nOne hypothesis of current study is participants will remember more words when words are more familiar or easier to imagine. However, participants may not consider themselves remember (metamemory) more imaginable words but they will for more familiar words, for the reason that imageability is not very easy to identify at first impression. The current paper studies how four attributes—imageability, familiarity, emotional valence and associated colors—affect people’s ability to remember words.\nFactorial design is an efficient way to design experiment to quickly investigate individual variable effects, as well as the ability to study interaction effects between variables. Here I will used factorial design with repeated measure to understand the following questions.\nHypothesis:\n  How word\u0026rsquo;s properties influence human memory ability?\n  How does individual word\u0026rsquo;s properties influence the differences in metacognition and recall?\n  Example stimuli of emotional valence and color variable. Each participant received a list of 20 words and ask to remember them.  Experimental Design Independent Variables Here I used 4X3 repeated measure design to study the following effects both individually and also their interactions.\n Emotional Valence Imageability Familiarity Colors  Design Specific design here is a full factorial design. Words’ order in each list was completely randomized. Each condition was replicated three times (three blocks) and each block contained completely randomized orders of 16 trials.\nMeasurements of memory   meta-memory : number of words they think they will remember. This measured subjects\u0026rsquo;s metacognition of self memory.\n  actual recall : number of words actually written down correctly. This is used to compare with meta-memory.\n  What I found While individual ANOVA analysis of response variable recall, or meta-cognition has not shown any significant effect dependent on words' properties. I further only looked at words overlap between words subjects they thought they would remember, and also they actually recalled later.\nHere I found out three $\\rho \u0026lt; 0.01$ interaction effects on the items subjects both thought they would remember, and also they actually recalled:\n Imageability and familarity Imageability and colors Emotional valence and familarity  Here it indicated that more imagenable and familiar words lead to better memory and also made deeper impression both consciously (through meta-cognition) and also subconsciously (recall).\nParticipants characteristics by Condition I additionally analyze how the participants use to remember words.\n Participants used at least one strategy (9.33) remember more than participants used no strategy at all (8.125). Most participants used strategies such as association, twist letter, phonetic clues to remember words.  Conclusion English words with following properties made more impression:\n Familiar words Negative words Emotional words  Also, words in cooler colors allowed subjects to imagine those words more easily, therefore possibly increasing their memory on those words. Additionally, using a strategy was important to recall english words.\nResource My code to analyze the experiment data can be found here (R Markdown file) and also on my github repository.

Procrastination definition\nProcrastination is the unplanned delaying tasks and procrastinators often feel guilty about their procrastination.\n2. Literature Research\nThen, I wanted to know if any researchers has systematically studied procrastination. So I searched studies on academic procrastination and summarized their findings on procrastination.\nSpecifically, procrastination can be divided into two categories.\n decisional procrastination behavioral procrastination.  3. Brain Storm\nAfter studying about procrastination study, then I visualized what a procrastinator (like myself) would do in each category.\nTypical behaviors of procrastinators are:\n missing deadlines making decisions until last minutes spend time on meaningless task before finishing task  Additionally, I included questions to ask about how individuals recognize their procrastination by asking question in these two additional categories.\n how they feel about procrastination the reasons for procrastinations  My questionnaire The current questionnaire is a self-evaluating scale focused on behavioral and decisional procrastinations in daily life and academic, reasons of procrastinations and feelings about procrastinations.\n Initially I had 50 items, then I analyzed the collected responses and end up with 25 items. 5-point likert scale  Population and sample I collected responses from 25 classmates in my psychometric class, which are all graduate students in academics so it fits my desired academic population.\nMeasuring my questionnaire I used the following measurements to understand how effective my questionnaire is at evaluating people\u0026rsquo;s internal states.\n Cohen\u0026rsquo;s kappa : Cohen\u0026rsquo;s kappa measures the agreement between two raters who each classify N items into mutually exclusive categories. inter-rater agreement : confidence of whether the cluster I assign it to other people also assign it to.  Potential Impact Procrastination scores were often related to lower self-regulations, lower self-efficacy, and higher neuroctism of personality trait. While most people would recognize procrastination as part of their personality, I hope this questionnaire would be their first step to identify specific behavior pattern and their general tendency to procrastination.\nImprovements Unfortunately, I lost the original collected data therefore cannot recover the measured statistics on individual items. This questionnaire was a psychometric class project and therefore hasn\u0026rsquo;t been widely studied in a bigger subject pool. If I have an opportunity, I would specifically collect responses from undergraduate students and see how different the response is comparing to graduate students'. Also, this questionnaire was designed in 2014 and people probably procrastinate with different things with advances in technology in 2021 (2021 still sounds like future to me).\nResources If you are intersted in using my questionnaire, you can find the printable pdf here (Procrastination Survey).\n","date":1417990712,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417990712,"objectID":"596babcaad297daa12118f458a44b3cf","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/project/procrastinatequestionnaire/","publishdate":"2014-12-07T14:18:32-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/procrastinatequestionnaire/","section":"project","summary":"How to design a questionnaire and also analyze response?","tags":["Questionnaire"],"title":"Procrastination Questionnaire Construction","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":[],"content":"What we want The problem In English, individual flowers are usually named with specific name of that flower (e.g., rose, tulip). However, in Chinese flowers are usually named by both the basic level name (e.g., rose, tulip) followed by subordinate level name (花, flower). For example, chamomile is named 菊花 or chamomile flower. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that Chinese native speakers categorize daily objects differently because how Chinese has built-in category information in the language.\nHere, we are interested in finding the priming effects of the language. First of all, we need a standardized bank of based on Chinese speakers in order to find the most representable objects inside each basic levle category (e.g., a typical dog species within dog, typical flower within flower)\nWhat We Had A bank of stimuli First, we collected a bank of stimuli using daily objects.
