Recent theories have heavily relied on the observation of category-specific activations, i.e., the preferential activations in brain regions for specific semantic categories. With decades of research, a full understanding of the organization has not yet been reached, since little is known about the factors that contribute to the variances in observed activation patterns across numerous neuroimaging studies. In this study, we first reviewed 97 published papers that reported category-specific activations for living or nonliving concepts in the past two decades. Then, using the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method, we characterized the brain activation associated with living and nonliving concepts, revealing the influences of relevant factors (e.g., neuroimaging mode, task demands, and stimuli modality), and analyzing these findings in relation to theoretical accounts of cortical semantic networks.","tags":null,"title":"Where for what: A meta-analysis for the category-specific activations for living/nonliving concepts in the past two decades","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612736335,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612736335,"objectID":"c085e70ec82beac36a74705ed122030c","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/project/wordproperties/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T14:18:55-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/wordproperties/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"WordProperties","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1612736312,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612736312,"objectID":"596babcaad297daa12118f458a44b3cf","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/project/procrastinatequestionnaire/","publishdate":"2021-02-07T14:18:32-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/procrastinatequestionnaire/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"ProcrastinateQuestionnaire","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["Imaging Analysis","tutorial"],"content":"","date":1607715565,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607715565,"objectID":"2eb425f7265ebe226cdcb84f91279f4c","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/post/imageorientation/","publishdate":"2020-12-11T11:39:25-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/imageorientation/","section":"post","summary":"So your neuroimage data somehow is flipped, what do you do?","tags":["Imaging Analysis","nifti","Brain Voyager","afni","FSL","freesurfer"],"title":"Neuroimage format and orientation information in nifti","type":"post"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou","Emily Grossman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"cbba2190022eef306e7cdd59f8d4aaa8","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/ifg2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ifg2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sensory and Social Cognitive Networks Connectivity Depends on Attentive States.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Stehr","Xiaojue Zhou","Mariel Tisby","Patrick Hwu","John Pyles","Emily Grossman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"856dc3b3c3b856e9ab877a5fddd0553e","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/mvpa2020_2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mvpa2020_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To test for the influence of top-down influences on action perceptual encoding, we evaluated the statistical structure of the multivariate activation pattern from the pSTS while observers attended to the different dimensions (the action kinematics, the goal, or the identity) of an avatar engaged in two different actions. Multivariate pattern decoding accuracy varied as a function of attention instruction in the right pSTS, but not in the other regions of the AON, with the highest classification when observers attended to the action kinematics. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the pSTS and inferior frontal cortex (IFC) was stronger when observers attended to the actions portrayed in the vignettes. Our findings are evidence that the attention goals of the viewer modulate sensory representations in the pSTS, which is proposals of the pSTS as an interstitial zone mediating top-down context and bottom-up perceptual cues during action observation.","tags":null,"title":"Top-down attention guidance shapes action encoding in the pSTS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["tutorial","Imaging Analysis"],"content":"Understanding Surface Preprocessing in Brain Voyager Surface reconstruction in freesurfer Surface group normalization (CBA alignment in BV) Move functional data to native surface (BV) Move functional data to reference surface (BV) Move volumetric ROI (VOI) to surface ROI (POI) (BV) Calculate functional connectivity in MATLAB Export functional connectivity map to surface statistical maps for visualization (BV) Non-parametric testing for thresholding whole brain connectivity analysis More Coming\u0026hellip;\n","date":1605830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607644800,"objectID":"6fd6c71c1b3cdfeda2895f4a76798feb","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/post/bvsurface/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bvsurface/","section":"post","summary":"Using Brain Voyager and MATLAB to do a computaionally efficient and intuitive surface analysis","tags":["Brain Voyager","Surface Analysis","freesurfer"],"title":"How to do surface functional connectivity analysis?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572274800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572274800,"objectID":"96344c08df50a1b693cc40432115cbe3","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/talk/example/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/example/","section":"talk","summary":"Functional connection between pSTS and IFG modulated by attention.","tags":[],"title":"Functional Connectivity During Action Recognition Modulated By Top-down Goals","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Kenwood M","Oler J","Fox A","Tromp D","Zhou X","Riedel M","Kalin N"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"c0488816129a4cf702c3bf74e58fde55","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/kalin2017_2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalin2017_2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Consequences of Altering Prefrontal-Temporal Lobe Connectivity in Young Nonhuman Primates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["statistic modeling"],"content":"The problem The sampling problem: if we sample faithfully to the real subpopulation ratio within a population (the true random sampling strategy), then we might get unstable estimates. However, if we oversample in one subpopulation, then we have to correct for the oversampling. For example, autism twins are very rare. If we want to accurately measure their psychologycal assessments, we want to upsample by intentionally taking more measurements in autism twin pairs than we would if we stay true to the ratio of autism twin pairs to normal twin pairs.\nHere, RDoC Study (2010-2012) Subsampling of Twin Pairs With Unequal Probability was a health survey on functional and structural neuroimaging and psychological assessments. They used a power strategy and took more samples in autism twin pairs.\nMy problem here is to pick a statistical strategy to estimate the true weights so the researchers can apply on their measurements to achieve both efficient and unbiased analysis.\nApproach Models to estimate weights Current study looks at different ways to calculate sample weights and compare their performances on the current dataset. Here, linear regression, polynomial regression, gamma linear regression, and gamma polynomial regression were used to estimate weights.\nBootstrapping to evaluate model performance 10000 times bootstrapping were performed to evaluate how different models performed in estimating weights.\nMeasurements of model performance   Efficiency : Ratio of standard deviation of bootstrapped original weights comparing to bootstrapped weights based on various methods described above. This is telling us how our newly estimated weights varied comparing to original weights.\n  Bias : Difference between average bootstrapped estimates. Here, it is the difference between original weights to bootstrapped weights based on methods described above. This is telling us how different our newly estimated weights comparing to original weights.\n  Results 1. Were the parameters biased?\nThe table below indicated that the parameter estimates were close to it\u0026rsquo;s original estimates. Also, across all the models, bias of different estimates (age, race, etc.,) were around zero. 2. Were the estimated weights efficient?\nHere, yg and xyg model, which was gamma modeling of unsmoothed and smoothed sampling weights had the highest efficiency in estimating weights.\nConclusion While all the models used above can estimate accuracte weights, Gamma and linear models using either un-smoothed or smoothed estimates have the highest efficiency in estimating weights.\nResource You can find the R code to do this analysis in my github respoitory.\n","date":1462313653,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462313653,"objectID":"a6a869e80cfd8edbfdb55b970b487756","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/project/surveyweight/","publishdate":"2016-05-03T14:14:13-08:00","relpermalink":"/project/surveyweight/","section":"project","summary":"Comparing different approaches to correct oversample datasets.","tags":["statistics"],"title":"Statistical Analysis of Weighted Survey Data in R","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":[],"content":"What we want The problem In English, individual flowers are usually named with specific name of that flower (e.g., rose, tulip). However, in Chinese flowers are usually named by both the basic level name (e.g., rose, tulip) followed by subordinate level name (花, flower). For example, chamomile is named 菊花 or chamomile flower. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that Chinese native speakers categorize daily objects differently because how Chinese has built-in category information in the language.\nHere, we are interested in finding the priming effects of the language. First of all, we need a standardized bank of based on Chinese speakers in order to find the most representable objects inside each basic levle category (e.g., a typical dog species within dog, typical flower within flower)\nWhat We Had A bank of stimuli First, we collected a bank of stimuli using daily objects. In the table below, each row is an picture representing a daily object. We want to know on average, if each item is named correctly and also consistenty among all the subjects.\nDesign experiment to observe verbal response An example stimuli In the experiment, we asked each subject to name a total of 400 individual pictures of objects and collected over 30 subjects' verbal response to each picture, as well as how fast they name the object.\nMeasurements of individual items For each item (picture), we calculated the following statistics:\n Entropy Average naming accuracy Total number of different labels Average response time  What We Found While this is still an ongoing project, we have established the bank of 285 individual pictures of daily animals and daily objects, each comes with the following information:\n Standardized Chinese name Corresponding English names Item\u0026rsquo;s basic semantic level Item\u0026rsquo;s surordinate level Average Response time Entropy  Future If you are interested in collaboration, please contact halleycl at gmail dot com.
