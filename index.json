Recent theories have heavily relied on the observation of category-specific activations, i.e., the preferential activations in brain regions for specific semantic categories. With decades of research, a full understanding of the organization has not yet been reached, since little is known about the factors that contribute to the variances in observed activation patterns across numerous neuroimaging studies. In this study, we first reviewed 97 published papers that reported category-specific activations for living or nonliving concepts in the past two decades. Then, using the Activation Likelihood Estimate (ALE) method, we characterized the brain activation associated with living and nonliving concepts, revealing the influences of relevant factors (e.g., neuroimaging mode, task demands, and stimuli modality), and analyzing these findings in relation to theoretical accounts of cortical semantic networks.","tags":null,"title":"Where for what: A meta-analysis for the category-specific activations for living/nonliving concepts in the past two decades","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["Imaging Analysis","tutorial"],"content":"","date":1607715565,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607715565,"objectID":"2eb425f7265ebe226cdcb84f91279f4c","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/post/imageorientation/","publishdate":"2020-12-11T11:39:25-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/imageorientation/","section":"post","summary":"So your neuroimage data somehow is flipped, what do you do?","tags":["Imaging Analysis","nifti","Brain Voyager","afni","FSL","freesurfer"],"title":"Neuroimage format and orientation information in nifti","type":"post"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou","Emily Grossman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"cbba2190022eef306e7cdd59f8d4aaa8","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/ifg2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ifg2021/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sensory and Social Cognitive Networks Connectivity Depends on Attentive States.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Stehr","Xiaojue Zhou","Mariel Tisby","Patrick Hwu","John Pyles","Emily Grossman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"856dc3b3c3b856e9ab877a5fddd0553e","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/mvpa2020_2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mvpa2020_2/","section":"publication","summary":"To test for the influence of top-down influences on action perceptual encoding, we evaluated the statistical structure of the multivariate activation pattern from the pSTS while observers attended to the different dimensions (the action kinematics, the goal, or the identity) of an avatar engaged in two different actions. Multivariate pattern decoding accuracy varied as a function of attention instruction in the right pSTS, but not in the other regions of the AON, with the highest classification when observers attended to the action kinematics. Furthermore, functional connectivity between the pSTS and inferior frontal cortex (IFC) was stronger when observers attended to the actions portrayed in the vignettes. Our findings are evidence that the attention goals of the viewer modulate sensory representations in the pSTS, which is proposals of the pSTS as an interstitial zone mediating top-down context and bottom-up perceptual cues during action observation.","tags":null,"title":"Top-down attention guidance shapes action encoding in the pSTS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaojue Zhou"],"categories":["tutorial","Imaging Analysis"],"content":"Understanding Surface Preprocessing in Brain Voyager Surface reconstruction in freesurfer Surface group normalization (CBA alignment in BV) Move functional data to native surface (BV) Move functional data to reference surface (BV) Move volumetric ROI (VOI) to surface ROI (POI) (BV) Calculate functional connectivity in MATLAB Export functional connectivity map to surface statistical maps for visualization (BV) Non-parametric testing for thresholding whole brain connectivity analysis More Coming\u0026hellip;\n","date":1605830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607644800,"objectID":"6fd6c71c1b3cdfeda2895f4a76798feb","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/post/bvsurface/","publishdate":"2020-11-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/bvsurface/","section":"post","summary":"Using Brain Voyager and MATLAB to do a computaionally efficient and intuitive surface analysis","tags":["Brain Voyager","Surface Analysis","freesurfer"],"title":"How to do surface functional connectivity analysis?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572274800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572274800,"objectID":"96344c08df50a1b693cc40432115cbe3","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/talk/example/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/example/","section":"talk","summary":"Functional connection between pSTS and IFG modulated by attention.","tags":[],"title":"Functional Connectivity During Action Recognition Modulated By Top-down Goals","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Kenwood M","Oler J","Fox A","Tromp D","Zhou X","Riedel M","Kalin N"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"c0488816129a4cf702c3bf74e58fde55","permalink":"https://zhouxiaojue.github.io/publication/kalin2017_2/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kalin2017_2/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Consequences of Altering Prefrontal-Temporal Lobe Connectivity in Young Nonhuman Primates","type":"publication"}]
